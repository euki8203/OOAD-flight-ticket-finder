### Overview: 

For this project we will design and develop a cloud based web application which will match the cheapest flight ticket 
with the user provided information (such as price range, date of travel, number of baggage, and etc.) using the data 
from the Skyscanner api. Reference: https://rapidapi.com/blog/skyscanner-api-overview/php/


### Instruction:

1. Get RapidAPI key from https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search and create a file called constants.js
in the api root folder. Populate constants.js with 

    `module.exports = Object.freeze({
    
        key : {your key}
        
    });`

   OR

   request constants.js to ashleykim0506@gmail.com


2. run `npm install` and `npm start` in the api root folder.

3. run `npm install` and `npm start` in the client root folder.
